- First release: 2001-02-23 ([all releases](https://github.com/aureliojargas/txt2regex/releases))

Txt2regex is a regular expression wizard for the command line.

Users with little or no knowledge of regular expressions can quickly
create hairy regexes by answering questions in a simple text-based
interactive interface.

Txt2regex is aware of the particular notation and caveats of many
different regular expression flavors, generating valid regexes for more
than 20 targets, including grep, sed, Vim, Emacs, JavaScript, Python,
PHP, PostgreSQL.

Txt2regex is a one-file shell script made 100% with Bash builtin
commands. The only requirement is Bash itself, since no grep, find, sed
or any other system command is used.


## Command line options

See [tests/cmdline.md](tests/cmdline.md) for a list of all the
available command line options and examples on using them.


## Features

See [tests/features.md](tests/features.md) for some of the special
features txt2regex has to handle user input and compose proper regexes.


## Running

Txt2regex is a stand-alone Bash script, it doesn't need to be installed.
Just run it:

    bash txt2regex.sh

Making it an executable file, you can run it directly:

    chmod +x txt2regex.sh
    ./txt2regex.sh

If you want it in [another language][pos] besides English:

    make install BINDIR=. LOCALEDIR=po
    LANG=es_ES ./txt2regex

## Regex tester to gather "real life" data

Txt2regex needs to know regex-related information for each flavor it
supports. For example:

- Which metacharacters are supported?
- How to escape a metacharacter to match it literally?
- Are POSIX character classes supported?

Instead of relying in documentation to get that information, the
[tests/regex-tester.sh](tests/regex-tester.sh) script calls the real
programs with specially crafted regexes and sample texts, verifying how
those programs behave in "real life".

To have a trackable and public record, the output of this tester is also
saved to this repository, in a readable and grepable plain text file:
[tests/regex-tester.txt](tests/regex-tester.txt). Future changes in
behavior can be easily detected.


## Testing

- `make test` — to run all the tests in the current Bash version on your
  machine.

- `make test-bash` — to run all the tests in all the released Bash
  versions since 3.0 (requires Docker).

- `make test-regex` — to run the regex tester (requires Docker).

Check the [Makefile](Makefile) for the details on what gets executed.

To translate txt2regex to your language:

- translate the [po/txt2regex.pot][potfile] file (in the `msgstr` lines)
- save it as `po/XX.po` (where XX is the [two-letter code][iso639] for
  your language)
- submit this new `.po` file in a pull request

## FAQ

### Why?

- To try to make simple regexes less painful for beginners.
- To have a reliable source for the specific regex syntax and rules from
  different flavors.
- To have coding fun :)

### What is that `<TAB>` that appears in the regex?

That `<TAB>` represents a literal tab character. When using the regex in
the desired external program, remember to change that to a literal tab.
This is required by programs that do not support using `\t` as a
shortcut for the tab character.

### Why my terminal size (lines/columns) is not detected?

Txt2regex uses the environment variables `$LINES` and `$COLUMNS` to get
the current terminal size. Make sure you have them exported, otherwise
the default 80x25 size will be assumed.

To check if the variables are exported, run:

```bash
bash -c 'echo $COLUMNS $LINES'
```

If no numbers are shown in the output, a quick fix is running:

```bash
export COLUMNS LINES
```

As a permanent fix, add the previous `export` command to a Bash
configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc`.
